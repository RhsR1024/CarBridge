## CarBridge 版本对齐规则

本仓库是 CarBridge 定制分支。自 2026-10-09 起，CarBridge 的显示版本
`versionName` 必须与实际已合并并验证的 DiPlay 上游版本一致，便于比较落后版本。
mobile 和 automotive 同步更新；debug 保留现有 `-debug` 后缀。
不得仅修改显示版本而未完成对应源码同步。

`versionCode` 使用 CarBridge 自己的单调递增序列，不能复制上游较小的整数而造成
安装降级。本次为 `0.2.15 / 111`，下一次交付的版本码必须更大；同一上游版本上的
定制修复保持上游显示版本，并增加内部版本码。包名、签名和用户设置保持兼容。

每次同时更新两个模块的构建配置、README、开发文档、CHANGELOG 和同步台账，
记录上游标签与完整提交；历史版本记录不回改。完整维护规则见
[UPSTREAM_SYNC.md](docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md#5-构建认证签名与版本)。

## Checks

Run the CI command from `.github/workflows/android.yml` before you report a change as done:

```sh
./gradlew :shared:testDebugUnitTest :common:testDebugUnitTest :home:testDebugUnitTest \
  :mobile:lintDebug :home:lintDebug :maphost:lintDebug \
  :mobile:assembleDebug :home:assembleDebug :maphost:assembleDebug
```

Set `ANDROID_HOME` or `local.properties` if Gradle cannot find the SDK.

## Adding or moving a setting

The Settings screen is grouped by driver goal, not by implementation.
`SettingsCategory`, `SettingsSection` and `SettingsInformationArchitecture` at the top of
`common/src/main/java/com/shilapi/xcertplay/DiPlayActivity.kt` define the groups.
`SettingsLayoutPolicyTest` fails when a section has no category or has more than one.

### Choose the category

Ask which goal the driver has when they look for the setting. Use the first row that fits.

| Category | Put a setting here when it controls… | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection | how the iPhone connects and how DiPlay starts | connection setup, connect on open, start with the car, USB permissions, car hotspot automation, iPhone choice, Android permissions |
| Display | how CarPlay looks on the head-unit screen | day/night mode, picture, size, resolution, frame rate, dock, system bars, multi-window resolution |
| Audio | what the driver hears | media and navigation streams, music buffer |
| Navigation | location and turn-by-turn guidance | location to iPhone, BYD HUD and cluster guidance |
| Vehicle | how CarPlay fits this car and its driver | driving side, wheel keys (Siri, BYD joystick and map zoom), car button, gestures that conflict with the head unit |
| Diagnostics | troubleshooting evidence | diagnostic reports |
| Advanced | experimental, firmware-specific or risky behavior | dashboard map, split screen, screen rotation, side panel, HEVC video, audio focus, audio channel mapping, buffered music, vehicle data |
| Overview | nothing new | see "Overview" below |

A setting goes to Advanced when it is experimental, depends on specific firmware, or is an opt-in that can break sound, video or the connection on some head units.
A control that fixes a common problem and is safe at its default (for example the audio stream choice) stays in its category.
Exception: a gated control that only its own audience sees, and that completes an everyday goal, stays in that goal's category.
Example: auto car hotspot needs ADB but appears only for car-hotspot users, so it is in Connection.

Mark an experimental setting or card with the title suffix ` (experimental)`, never `· experimental`, a dash, or an `Experimental …` prefix.
Each locale MUST use its existing form: `(تجريبي)`, `(experimental)`, `(экспериментально)`, `(експериментально)`, `（实验性）`, `（實驗性）`.

### Add the code

1. To extend an existing card, add the control inside the `filteredSection(...)` block of a card in the correct category.
2. For a new card, add a `SettingsSection` entry and map it to exactly one category in `SettingsInformationArchitecture.sectionsByCategory`.
3. Build the new card with `filteredSection(content, SettingsSection.X, …)` inside `allSettingsSections()`.
   A plain `section(...)` call there MUST NOT be used: it renders on every category page.
4. A setting MUST NOT appear in two categories.
   Overview quick settings are the only duplicates. They MUST use the same persistence as the full control. Overview SHOULD NOT have more than four quick settings.
   A header shortcut MAY duplicate a Display setting when it uses the same persistence.
5. If the change reconnects CarPlay or applies at the next connection, the description MUST say so.
   A setting that only takes effect at the next connection MUST call `markReconnectNeeded()` after it saves.
   This shows the "Reconnect now" bar. It MUST NOT drop a running session without the driver's consent.
   Reconnect at once (`reconnectIfRunning()`) only after a dialog button that says "Apply and reconnect", or when the description says that the change reconnects CarPlay.
6. Add each new string to `common/src/main/res/values/` and to every `values-xx` locale folder.
   New Settings copy SHOULD use the `settings_` prefix. `SettingsTranslationsTest` fails when a `settings_*` string has no translation.
7. A control that opens a choice uses `button()` with the text `"Title · Value"`.
   That form renders as a setting row with the value and a chevron, and Search indexes the title.
8. When you move a control between categories, update `AdaptiveSettingsUiTest.settingsLiveWhereDriversLookForThem`.

### Overview

Overview holds the connection status, links to the categories, quick settings, About and Language.
Do not add a new setting to Overview. Add it to its category. Then promote it to quick settings only if drivers change it often.
